    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // let name = 'Wes';
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // name = 'wesley';
    // console.log(name, name2);


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    //const team = players;//make reference to original array players

    //team[3] = "Lux";//this will update original players array as well
    //console.log(team);
    
    // make copy with slice() method
    const team2 = players.slice();//makes a copy not reference
    team2[3] ="lux";
    // console.log(team2);
    // console.log(players);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // second way to make copy instead of reference create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = "Lana";
    // console.log(team3);
    // console.log(players);

    // thrid way to make copy of array instead of referencing it use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = "Niaz";
    // console.log(team4);
    // console.log(players);

    //fourth way to make copy of array Array.from()
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = "Lera";
    // console.log(team5);
    // console.log(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;//this is not copy , its reference
    //captain.number = 90;//it will change number for person as well;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    //first way to make a copy of object instead making reference Object.assign()
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 90, age: 12});
    

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //second way make copy of object 
    const captain3 = {...person};
    captain3.name = "Lana Khan";

    //third way to make copy of object, not recommended;
    const captain4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
